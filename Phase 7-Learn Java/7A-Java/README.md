# Phase 7A: Java

Java is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, robustness, and high performance. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing compiled code to run on any system that supports the JVM, making it a popular choice for enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Understand Javaâ€™s syntax, types, and object-oriented principles
- Write modular, reusable code with classes and interfaces
- Manage memory using Javaâ€™s garbage collector
- Handle exceptions and use robust error management patterns
- Compile and run Java applications using `javac` and `java`
- Use packages and build tools like Maven or Gradle

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- **Java** â€“ [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)  
- **Maven** â€“ [Maven Docs](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html)  
- **Gradle** â€“ [Gradle Docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Focus on writing clean, well-structured Java programs that reinforce object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Understanding Javaâ€™s core libraries and JVM execution model is essential before moving into frameworks like Spring.
