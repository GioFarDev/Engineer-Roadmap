# Phase 7: Java Spring

Spring is a powerful Java framework for building enterprise-level web applications and microservices. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model through features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and built-in support for web development with Spring MVC.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Understand the principles of Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and Spring MVC
- Use annotations for configuration and routing
- Connect to databases using Spring Data JPA
- Configure and manage Spring applications with application properties
- Test components using Springâ€™s testing tools

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- **Spring Framework** â€“ [Spring Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/)  
- **Spring Boot** â€“ [Spring Boot Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)  
- **Spring Data JPA** â€“ [Spring Data JPA Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Spring Boot simplifies setup and configuration, making it the preferred entry point for new Spring projects. Build projects that highlight DI, RESTful endpoints, and database persistence. Ensure you understand application context and bean lifecycle.
