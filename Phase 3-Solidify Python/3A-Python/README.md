# Phase 3A: Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple paradigms including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. Widely used across domains like web development, automation, data science, and AI, Pythonâ€™s extensive ecosystem of libraries makes it highly adaptable and beginner-friendly.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Understand Pythonâ€™s core syntax and dynamic typing
- Write clean, readable, and idiomatic Python code
- Use built-in data structures and functions
- Manage packages and dependencies with pip and venv
- Handle errors and exceptions properly
- Build scripts and automation tools

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- **Python** â€“ [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
- **pip** â€“ [pip Documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  
- **venv** â€“ [venv Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Focus on mastering Python fundamentals like data structures, control flow, functions, modules, and error handling. Build small utilities or CLI tools to reinforce scripting and automation. Python forms the foundation for frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI, making it critical for full-stack and back-end development.
