# Phase 2B: ML Engineering and Cloud

This phase focuses on productionizing machine learning models, containerisation, and cloud deployment. Itâ€™s recommended to undertake this phase after securing a developer role.

Youâ€™ll learn to integrate ML models into applications and manage CI/CD pipelines in cloud environments.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Containerise ML models using Docker
- Deploy ML-powered applications to AWS or Azure
- Build CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Develop APIs that connect front-end and ML back-end
- Prepare for cloud developer certifications

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- **TensorFlow** â€“ [TensorFlow Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)  
- **Docker** â€“ [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)  
- **AWS / Azure** â€“ [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) / [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)  
- **CI/CD Tools** â€“ GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or equivalent  
- **Python** â€“ [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This phase is highly practical and cloud-focused. Seek to apply learning at work where possible. Focus on automation and integration.
