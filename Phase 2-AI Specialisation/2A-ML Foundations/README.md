# Phase 2A: ML Foundations

This phase introduces the basics of data science and machine learning using Python and key libraries. Youâ€™ll focus on data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to build a standalone ML model and document my work clearly.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Master Python fundamentals for data science
- Use Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Build and train machine learning models with Scikit-learn
- Document my process in Jupyter Notebooks
- Understand model evaluation metrics

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- **Python** â€“ [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
- **Pandas** â€“ [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)  
- **NumPy** â€“ [NumPy Docs](https://numpy.org/doc/)
