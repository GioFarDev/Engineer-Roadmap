# Phase 2: AI Specialisation

This phase is designed to build a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a practical focus on engineering and cloud deployment. It progresses from core ML concepts to the operational aspects of deploying and managing AI solutions in a cloud environment, culminating in industry-recognized cloud certifications.

## Overview

*   **2A: ML Foundations:** Establish a solid understanding of data science and machine learning fundamentals using Python. Learn data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy, model training with Scikit-learn, and effective documentation using Jupyter Notebooks.
*   **2B: ML Engineering and Cloud:** Transition from theoretical ML to practical ML engineering. Focus on containerizing models with Docker, deploying ML-powered applications to cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), and building CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. This sub-phase is ideally undertaken after gaining initial developer experience.
*   **2C: Cloud Certifications:** Validate cloud development expertise by preparing for and obtaining key industry certifications. This includes mastering cloud-native development principles, serverless architectures, and managed services on both AWS (AWS Certified Developer - Associate) and Azure (AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure).

## Key Technologies & Tools Covered

*   **ML Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
*   **Data Science:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins (or equivalents)
*   **Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, RDS, SQS, SNS, IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch; Azure Functions, App Service, Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure AD, Azure Resource Manager, Azure Monitor.

## Learning Philosophy

This phase emphasizes a hands-on approach to machine learning, moving from foundational data science to the practicalities of MLOps and cloud deployment. The focus is on building deployable solutions and understanding the end-to-end lifecycle of an ML application. Certification preparation reinforces theoretical knowledge with practical application.

## Career Integration

While foundational ML skills can be acquired at any stage, the ML Engineering and Cloud sub-phase is best pursued after securing a developer role, allowing for direct application of learned concepts in a professional setting. Cloud certifications provide tangible proof of expertise, enhancing career opportunities in cloud-native and AI-driven development roles.
