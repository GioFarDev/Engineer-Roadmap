# Phase 1A: Front-End Development

This phase lays the foundation for my career as a developer. The primary goal is to become proficient in the core technologies of the modern web â€” focusing on structure, style, and interactivity. Youâ€™ll build static and dynamic web pages while gaining strong skills in semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and modern JavaScript, including React and state management with Redux.

You will also explore modern tooling, project organisation, and deploy basic projects online.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Understand how the web works (HTTP, DNS, hosting, browsers)
- Write accessible, semantic HTML
- Style interfaces with clean, responsive CSS (including Flex-box & Grid)
- Master JavaScript fundamentals (DOM, events, loops, functions, conditionals)
- Develop React components and manage state with Redux
- Use browser dev tools effectively
- Write unit and integration tests with Mocha
- Host and deploy websites using modern platforms

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is the largest phase in terms of individual modules. Focus on practical coding and building projects. Utilise testing frameworks like Mocha early to build good habits. Use flashcards (e.g., Anki) and progressively increase project complexity.
