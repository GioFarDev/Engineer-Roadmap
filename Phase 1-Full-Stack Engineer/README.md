# Phase 1: Full-Stack Engineer

This phase is dedicated to transforming into a proficient Full-Stack Engineer, with a strong emphasis on modern web development practices. It covers everything from foundational front-end skills to robust back-end development and the integration of both to build complete, scalable applications.

## Overview

*   **1A: Front-End Development:** Master the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Gain proficiency in React and Redux for building dynamic user interfaces. Focus on responsive design, accessibility, and effective use of browser developer tools.
*   **1B: Advanced Front-End:** Elevate front-end skills with TypeScript for type-safe code, and explore advanced React frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance. Introduction to Angular for broader framework understanding.
*   **1C: Back-End Development:** Dive into server-side programming using Node.js and Express.js. Learn to design and implement relational databases with PostgreSQL, build RESTful APIs, and understand authentication mechanisms.
*   **1D: Full-Stack Completion:** Integrate front-end and back-end components to build complete applications. Focus on secure user authentication, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and end-to-end testing to ensure application reliability and security.

## Key Technologies & Tools Covered

*   **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React, Redux, TypeScript, Next.js, Angular
*   **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
*   **Testing:** Mocha, Cypress, Playwright
*   **Deployment & CI/CD:** Netlify, GitHub Actions
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Learning Philosophy

This phase emphasizes hands-on project building, practical application of concepts, and continuous learning. You will progressively build more complex applications, starting from static web pages and culminating in full-stack deployed solutions. Testing and security are integrated throughout the learning process to foster best practices.

## Job Search Integration

Job hunting for junior front-end roles is encouraged to begin during the Back-End Development sub-phase (1C), allowing for practical experience while continuing to strengthen full-stack capabilities.
