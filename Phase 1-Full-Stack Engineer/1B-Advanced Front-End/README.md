# Phase 1B: Advanced Front-End

This phase deepens my front-end expertise by introducing TypeScript, advanced React frameworks such as Next.js, and exploring Angular. The goal is to build highly maintainable, scalable applications using typed languages and modern frameworks.

You will also develop skills in server-side rendering, routing, and state management to prepare for advanced projects.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Learn and apply TypeScript with React
- Understand Next.js fundamentals (SSR, routing, API routes)
- Explore Angular architecture and build simple apps
- Strengthen my knowledge of component-driven design and state management
- Build portfolio projects with multiple frameworks
