# Phase 1C: Back-End Development

This phase focuses on back-end development fundamentals using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. Youâ€™ll learn to build RESTful APIs, design relational databases, and handle server-side logic.

Job hunting begins in this phase, so youâ€™ll be applying for junior front-end roles while strengthening back-end skills.

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Build and deploy REST APIs with Node.js and Express.js
- Design and implement PostgreSQL databases
- Understand authentication and user management basics
- Learn back-end debugging and testing methods
- Prepare for job interviews with practical back-end knowledge
